#+TODO: TODO DOING | DONE

* Todo list
  
  - Document routing
  - Upsert
  - Gossip infrastructure
  - Allocate under replicated shards when nodes come online
  - Cluster health (i.e. are we under replicated? are we available?)
  - Allow nodes to join cluster without joining master raft group
  - Don't poll for state changes, leader should broadcast events
  
* Tantivy Issues
  - Max field count is 255
  - Threading is weird. I want to manage the thread pool across many indices
