#+TODO: TODO DOING | DONE

* Current Notes
  * Should split RPC into two services (KV and Search)
  * RaftRouter will replace NetworkActor
  * Need to replace RaftClient with another process

* Todo list
  
** High Priority

  - Remove `actix` (single threaded is going to be problematic)
  - Gossip infrastructure
    - Cache shard routing table
    - Broadcast member list
  - Search should respond with source
  - Better RPC error information - hard to tell what is causing the errors
  - Setup clippy, rustfmt

** Everything else
   
  - Consider switching out actix-web for something else
  - Leaseholders
    - https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#range-leases
  - Cluster health (i.e. are we under replicated? are we available?)
  - Upsert
    - use bloom filter to track if a document exists
    - delete document before indexing if needed
  - Allocate under replicated shards when nodes come online
  - Allow nodes to join cluster without joining master raft group
  - Don't poll for state changes, leader should broadcast events
  
* Tantivy Issues
  - Max field count is 255
  - Threading is weird. I want to manage the thread pool across many indices

* Neat Ideas
  - Avoid dirty reads!
  - Can we provide even better consistency guarantees?
  - Joins! 
    - https://www.memsql.com/blog/scaling-distributed-joins/
  - Autoscaling
    - Split shards at certain conditions
    - Add replicas at certain conditions
